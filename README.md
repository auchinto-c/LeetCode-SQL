# LeetCode-SQL

This is a public repository created to consolidate optimised proposal solutions for the SQL Questions available on LeetCode. The aim of this repo is to help others exploring their way through SQL queries.

The Directory structure can be navigated as follows:
1. Go to the specific directory, based on the Difficulty label as **Easy / Medium / Hard**
2. Within each of these Difficulty labels, one can find a list of directories, each representing a single question
3. Within each question directory, one can find the following two files:
   1. **README** - Describing the question and the proposed solution(s)
   2. **SQL File** - Comprising all queries from creation of table, insertion of records and final DML queries

There can be multiple solutions to a single question, and there can be solutions better than the proposed ones. Feel free to raise a PR to send in your proposals.
